    <p><strong><u>App Development: Creative Expression (CSE)</u></strong></p>

    <p>This project is a game, built with MIT App Inventor, that allows the player to build an ice cream dessert and
      “eat” it by tapping on the finished dessert. Working on this project taught me about canvases, user input and some
      rough graphic design. Several challenges I had to overcome were struggling to use MIT App Inventor and realizing
      in the middle of coding that there was a much better approach, but the deadline was coming up, so I had to decide
      that whatever works works.</p>

    <p>ssg.py is a static site generator, written in python. It takes a source directory containing Markdown files,
      converts them to html using the pandoc tool, creates a sitemap, RSS and Atom feeds, and writes them to a
      destination directory. It is specifically useful for computer users familiar with the command line, and I wrote it
      in Python for readability and stability. Working on this project taught me more about many advanced
      Python features, such as format strings, regular expressions, sets and file I/O. Several challenges I had to
      overcome were: struggling to understand the many types of regex out in the wild, many bugs cropping up in
      unexpected places, and using many libraries with which I had no previous experience.</p>

    <p>In this CSP Project, my partner Ishaan and I acted as incident responders, investigating the breach of a
      internet-connected fishtank inside a casino. We analyzed email records, logs, and Python code files. In this
      process we discovered suspicious activity, as well as fixing several bugs in the code we found. Working on this
      project gave us a taste of what cybersecurity in industry is like. We also improved our communication skills and
      learned to work better as a team.</p>

    <p>funimuni is a project to improve transparency in politics, by pulling data from government agencies (like the
      FEC) and displaying it more intuitively through graphs. As the main programmer, I built the current iteration of
      the app, which displays information about political
      candidates, showing where they get their money and how much money they raise over time; however, we have many
      plans for improvement. Building funimuni taught me about SQL databases, data analysis, web design, and the
      intricacies of Python. </p>
