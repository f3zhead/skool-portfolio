    <p>Hello, I'm Franklin! I'm a sophomore at Dublin High School, and I'm passionate about programming, writing and
      math. </p>
    <p>I have a long history with STEM; ever since first grade I have loved math, and I took up programming
      during quarantine. I have spent countless hours studying math (both for competitions and for fun), and hacking on
      personal programming projects. You can check them out on my <a href="/projects.html">Projects</a> page. From these
      experiences I've learned a lot about what is necessary to be a good programmer or mathematician: curiosity,
      persistence, and a willingness to endlessly Google.
    </p>
    <p>I'm also pursuing STEM in school. In my freshman year, I took CSE (Computer Science Essentials), which taught
      basic programming skills. This year I'm taking AP CSP (Computer Science Principles), which touches on various
      aspects of computing, from program design to cybersecurity to social impacts.</p>
    <p>I hope to build more on what I have learned, by trying new and more challenging things. I'd like to do this
      through my own personal projects; I have plenty of ideas on what to do, including games, contributions to the
      Linux kernel, and just fixing annoyances in computing I encounter every day. I'd also like to expand my knowledge
      by going to a technical school such as MIT, Caltech of Berkeley. At this level, I would have the skills and
      platform to share what I've learned and use it to help others.</p>
