<h1 class="title">Career Exploration</h1>
<p class="date"> 2022-03-07 </p>
<p>During high school and middle school, I have explored careers in software development by researching in classes like Freshman Seminar, and outside of classes. From this I have learned the varied sub-fields there are in software development, almost all of which interest me (except frontend). In addition, I have talked to many industry professionals who have worked in a variety of fields, from kernel development to graphics. From them I learned the importance of getting your hands dirty and creating projects, which is the best way to learn programming. Until I followed their advice, I didn’t feel like I was getting anywhere, but after completing my first real non-trivial program, I had a sense of achievement that I hadn’t felt in a while.</p>
<p>This feeling has definitely strengthened my idea that I want to be a computer programmer, but I am still open to completely different fields of study. I have also taught programming to others with less experience, which I found to be an altogether enjoyable experience. It was tiring, however, even though I didn’t have to assign homework or grade anything. This experience helped my mentoring skills, and from it I learned the importance of flexibility (at one point screensharing didn’t work, which was scary because the class was over Zoom) and building rapport with my assistant and students.</p>
