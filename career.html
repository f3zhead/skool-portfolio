    <h1 class="title">Career Exploration</h1>
    <p>During high school, I have explored several avenues of a STEM career. I am currently working as a community
      manager at Code2Win, a coding club centering around competitions like USACO and personal projects. There I
      coordinate activities and assist in running club meetings. I also have experience teaching programming, as I
      taught Python to middle schoolers for charity, with a very favorable response. This experience helped my mentoring
      skills, and it taught me the importance of flexibility
      (at one point screensharing didnâ€™t work, which was scary because the class was over Zoom) and building rapport
      with my assistant and students.</p>
    <p>
      I have also done research into STEM careers. I have talked to
      industry professionals (like Nathan Lewis) who have worked in a variety of fields, from kernel development to
      graphics to rocket
      software. I have also met professional mathematicians, such as Arthur T. Benjamin and Matt Parker at the Joint
      Math Meeting, the largest gathering of mathematicians in the world. From them I
      learned about what life of a STEM professional looks like, but the most important lesson I took away was I
      the importance of getting my hands dirty, building projects and playing with ideas.
      Moving forward in life, I will continue to pursue STEM, for fun and (hopefully) some profit as well.</p>
